"""Inject host-backend egress allowlists into an OpenShell policy.

The sandboxed NAT agent is hardened by an OpenShell network policy that default-denies egress.
When the agent's tools call backend services running on the host (outside OpenShell), the policy
must allowlist those ``host.docker.internal:<port>`` endpoints. This module adds that block
idempotently so it survives the permissive transform and policy-repair cycles.
