"""Stage a build context for the user's Relay-connected victim image.

OpenShell builds the sandbox image from ``sandbox create --from <Dockerfile>`` using the
Dockerfile's parent directory as the build context, and cannot forward ``--build-arg``. So we stage
a build dir: copy the user's project into it and place their Dockerfile at its root.

Agent Hardener does not render a Dockerfile of its own. Tier 1 hardens the agent the user actually
ships, so building a *different* image would undercut the result — the image is theirs, and the only
thing we add is the egress shim the sandbox needs to route their traffic through its proxy.
