"""The ``agent-hardener`` command-line interface.

A single entrypoint for running Agent Hardener against a user's agent. ``run`` is the bash script
replacement: expand the manifest, bring up host backends, build + harden the agent in OpenShell, and
clean up (the garak agent_breaker attacker spawns the garak CLI itself). ``init`` scaffolds a manifest
plus a ``garak-scan.yaml`` config; ``up``/``down``/``status`` expose the sandbox lifecycle.

One module per command lives beside this file; importing them here registers each on the shared ``app``.
The import order fixes the order commands appear in ``--help``.
