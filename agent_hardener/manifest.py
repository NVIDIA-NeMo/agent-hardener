"""Thin agent manifest and its expansion into a full :class:`SessionConfig`.

A user describes *only their agent* in a small ``agent-hardener.yaml`` (``agent`` + optional
``backends`` + optional ``overrides``). :func:`expand` turns that into the full orchestrator
``SessionConfig`` — deriving the victim target, the OpenShell ``relay_victim`` build spec, and the
default attacker/defender/validator suite — so the easy path stays ~10 lines while power users keep
the full config as an escape hatch.

#: given. Runs died as OOM kills, and the scorecard reported them as unblocked attacks.

#: send a session id, and it never reads response headers, so it cannot ``DELETE`` one either.
#: Pinning a single session id would also bound memory and must not be done — the attacks would share
#: one conversation, and each would read the previous attack's context.
